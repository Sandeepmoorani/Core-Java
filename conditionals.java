// The if-else statement is an extension to the if-statement, which uses another block of code, i.e., else block.
// The else block is executed if the condition of the if-block is evaluated as false.

// Syntax:

if(condition) {    
statement 1; //executes when condition is true   
}  
else{  
statement 2; //executes when condition is false   
}
